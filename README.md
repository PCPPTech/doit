# DOIT
The project is still under development but the idea is a more fun Task Manager where you have your profile and by completing quests you can get DOIT coins and for those coins you can buy some cosmetics to spice up your profile!

## SMALL NOTE
The app is easily exploitable and it isn't meant to be a serious thing, I am just testing my skills and how good can I utilize AI

# AI USE
Artificial Intelligence was only used for the frontend in the project, or design ideas. The backend is my work, and the whole app is my idea without any AI inspiration.

# CHANGES 2025.07.26
- Added profile, shop, guide and other buttons to the menu, with most of them being without functionality, but that fact will be changed
- Added functionality for `Add Task`, `Guide` and `Clear All`.
- **The app is still under development meaning it has a lot of bugs that are to be fixed soon. I am trying to commit to this repo everyday**.

# CHANGES 2025.07.27

- **Main content frame properly not updating**
